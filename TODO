look at stdlib/vardir.rb and do something like this

Facter.add(:getinstallerpath) do
  setcode do
     Facter::Util::Resolution.exec(puppet config print)

and convert it into a Hash by iterating over the results.
https://puppet.com/docs/facter/3.9/fact_overview.html

But there really should be a way to look at teh Module datastructure directly from Ruby and dump that into a hash if
it isn't one already. https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/lib/puppet/settings.rb
It looks like either @config or @values. Accessor function is called 'values(env, section)'
There is a puppet::settings::values Class. 

Also if you Facter.add(:label) but the label was previously used (eg. 'os') does it merge or last wins?

add s3cmd to modules/aws. https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd/releases/download/v2.0.1/s3cmd-2.0.1.tar.gz but probably much easier to just 'pip install s3cmd'.
also ec2-net-utils.rpm

add 'perf', netperf and psacct RPM to modules/os - allows visibility into ram/proc stats beyond the normal stuff

ntopng is from http://packages.ntop.org/

create 'modules/monitoring/nagios.pp' and add various packages
nrpe, nagios-plugins-all

Fix File resource inability to handle Ints intead of just strings. (puppet version too old?)
