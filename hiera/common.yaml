# Overview of each setting:
#
# use_local:
#   This is a list of each URL path you would like to have directed to
#   your local server. If, for example you are running ITSS locally
#   you would want to put 'rba_modernization' in this list. See below
#   for examples and a full list of possible values.
#
# jboss::proxy_name:
#   This is the URL/FQDN the application(s) you are running locally
#   will be at. For example if you are running ITSS you'd want this to
#   be 'lab5-was.itss.gsarba.com. If you are running TOS you'd want to
#   use 'lab5-tos.fas.gsarba.com', and so on.
#
# yum::packages:
#   Use this to list any additional yum packages you would like to have
#   installed. Just make sure they don't clash with any that Puppet is
#   already installing or you will get an error message.
